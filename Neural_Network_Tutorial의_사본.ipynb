In addition, since we are interested in modeling processes of the human brain, we would like the activation function to be **monotonically** increasing. This means: the higher the input to the unit, the higher its activity (i.e. the stronger the response of the underlying neural population). Finally, we would like to constrain the activity of the unit. For instance, we wouldn't want to allow for activations below 0 (what does that even mean?), so we set a lower bound at 0 (0% activity). For convenience, we also would want to limit our activity to 1 (corresponding to 100% activity). Fortunately, the sigmoid function introduced above fits our needs."

For example, imagine that there were two hidden layers and the activity of the second one fed back into the first one in a loop. In the case of \"convolutional neural networks,\" we just apply a special mathematical function called a convolution (think: averaging with a sliding window) to connect a big layer with a much smaller layer. For example, imagine that the input layer was not just 2 numbers, but rather an image, so a matrix of 256 x 256 numbers. We could connect it to the much smaller hidden layer via a convolution.\n"

        "*   When comparing the learning curves for the AND/OR and the XOR condition, you should observe that the network requires fewer training iterations to learn AND/OR compared to XOR. Moreover, you may also observe a two-stage learning curve for the XOR condition in which learning slows down and then accelerates again. This reflects an additional adjustment of the input-hidden weights that is required to learn the XOR rule. First, the network learns to adjust the hidden-output weights to reduce the error—this already sufficient to learn the OR/AND rule. However, to learn the XOR rule, the network needs to learn a non-linear mapping of the input space, thus, requiring an additional adjustment of the input-hidden weights (reflected in the second acceleration of the learning curve). Such stage-like transitions in the learning curve can explain developmental transitions in semantic cognition (Saxe, Ganguli, McClelland, 2019).\n",
        "*   When the network is initialized with smaller weights, its gradient updates end up being fairly small (due to the small derivatives). Thus, the network requires more iterations for training. This small exercise demonstrates that weight initialization matters. In fact, a good chunk of machine learning research is concerned with identifying good initialization conditions."

For instance, you may be familiar with the so-called Stroop task in which participants have to name the color of a color word, e.g., say \"green\" in response to:\n",

In addition, participants make fewer errors when color naming to congruent relative to incongruent stimuli, irrespective of the task. Analogously, researchers hypothesized that congruent stimuli require less mental effort (cognitive control) than incongruent stimuli."

The input layer on the right encodes the current word. For instance, if the word would is \"GREEN\" then we can set the word input layer to $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. Finally, the input layer in the middle encodes the task to be performed on the two stimuli. For instance, if the participant would be asked to perform the color naming task, one would set the input units of the task demand layer to $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",

However, the cool part about the Stroop model is that the *TASK DEMAND* layer can provide additional net input to the hidden units, making it possible to disinhibit them. For instance, if we set the color naming unit to 1, then we can provide additonal net input to the color hidden units. This negates the negative bias, allowing information from the *INK COLOR* input layer to flow through to the *RESPONSE* layer. Conversely, if we leave the word reading unit in the *TASK DEMAND* layer at 0, then the information from the *WORD* layer cannot leak through. The output layer would then only receive input from the color hidden units, thus enabling the network to perform the color naming task. This provides a mechanism for mental effort: allocating mental effort to a task means to activate a task demand unit (i.e., set it to 1).\n",

Wouldn't it be nice if we could show that this behavior results indeed from training? To do so, you may want to think tacke two extended exercises:\n",
